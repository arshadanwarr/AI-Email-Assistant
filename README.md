🧠 AI Email Assistant – Summarizer, Classifier & Reply Generator
This is an AI-powered email assistant web app built using Streamlit and custom fine-tuned NLP models. It helps users interact with email content more efficiently by summarizing, classifying, and generating intelligent replies to messages.

🚀 Features
📝 Summarization: Automatically shortens long emails using a fine-tuned Seq2Seq model (e.g., BART).
📌 Classification: Categorizes email content into labels like Work, Spam, Finance, HR, etc., using a fine-tuned BERT-based classifier.
✉️ Reply Generation: Suggests context-aware email replies with a fine-tuned conversational language model (e.g., DialoGPT).

🛠 Tech Stack
Streamlit – for building the user interface
PyTorch – for loading and running models
Transformers (by Hugging Face) – for NLP model architecture
Custom Fine-Tuned Models – trained specifically on email datasets for better relevance and performance.
